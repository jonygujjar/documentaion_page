    <article>
      <p>
        Most Windows and Mac computers come with Python pre-installed. You can check
        that via a Command Line search. The particular appeal of Python is that you can
        write a program in any text editor, save it in .py format and then run via a Command
        Line. But as you learn to write more complex code or venture into data science, you
        might want to switch to an IDE or IDLE
      </p>

      <p>
        Shell is the default mode of operation for Python IDLE. In essence, it’s a simple loop
        that performs that following four steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reads the Python statement</li>
        <li>Evaluates the results of it </li>
        <li>Prints the result on the screen</li>
        <li>And then loops back to read the next statement. </li>

      </ul>

    <header>Main Python Data Types</header>
    <article>
      Every value in Python is called an “object”. And every object has a specific data
      type. The three most-used data types are as follows:
      Integers (int) — an integer number to represent an object such as “number 3”.
      Strings — codify a sequence of characters using a string. For example, the word
      “hello”. In Python 3, strings are immutable. If you already defined one, you cannot
      change it later on.
      While you can modify a string with commands such as replace() or join(), they will
      create a copy of a string and apply modification to it, rather than rewrite the original
      one.
      Plus, another three types worth mentioning are lists, dictionaries, and tuples. All of
      them are discussed in the next sections. 
      <p>
        For now, let’s focus on the strings.
        Floating-point numbers (float) — use them to represent floating-point numbers.
        Integers -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
        Strings ‘yo’, ‘hey’, ‘Hello!’, ‘what’s up!’
        Floating-point numbers -1.25, -1.0, --0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.2

    <header>How to Create a String in Python</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        You can create a string in three ways using single, double or triple quotes. Here’s an
        example of every option:
      </p>
      <code>my_string = “Let’s Learn Python!”
        another_string = ‘It may seem difficult first, but you
        can do it!’
        a_long_string = ‘’’Yes, you can even master multi-line
        strings
        that cover more than one line
        with some practice’’’
      </code>

    <header>How to Store Strings in Variables</header>
    <p>
      Variables in Python 3 are special symbols that assign a specific storage location to
      a value that’s tied to it. In essence, variables are like special labels that you place on
      some value to know where it’s stored.
      Strings incorporate data. So you can “pack” them inside a variable. Doing so makes
      it easier to work with complex Python programs.
      Here’s how you can store a string inside a variable.
    </p>
    <code>my_str = “Hello World”
      print(my_str)
      = Hello World</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Built_in_Functions_in_Python">
    <header>Built in Functions in Python</header>
    <article>
      You already know the most popular function in Python — print(). Now let’s take a
      look at its equally popular cousins that are in-built in the platform.
      <p>
        input() function is a simple way to prompt the user for some input (e.g. provide their
        name). All user input is stored as a string.
        Here’s a quick snippet to illustrate this: <code>name = input(“Hi! What’s your name? “)
          print(“Nice to meet you “ + name + “!”)
          age = input(“How old are you “)
          print(“So, you are already “ + str(age) + “ years old, “
          + name + “!”)</code>
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="How_to_Define_a_Function">
    <header>How to Define a Function</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Apart from using in-built functions, Python 3 also allows you to define your own
        functions for your program.
        To recap, a function is a block of coded instructions that perform a certain action.
        Once properly defined, a function can be reused throughout your program i.e. re-use
        the same code.
        Here’s a quick walkthrough explaining how to define a function in Python:
        First, use def keyword followed by the function name():. The parentheses can
        contain any parameters that your function should take (or stay empty)
      </p>
      <code>name.py
        def name():
        print(“What’s your name?”)
        hello()</code>
      <p>
        Now, let’s take a look at a defined function with a parameter — an entity, specifying
        an argument that a function can accept.
      </p>
      <code>def add_numbers(x, y, z):
        a = x + y
        b = x + z
        c = y + z
        print(a, b, c)
        add_numbers(1, 2, 3)</code>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
    <header>Lists</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Lists are another cornerstone data type in Python used to specify an ordered
        sequence of elements. In short, they help you keep related data together and
        perform the same operations on several values at once. Unlike strings, lists are
        mutable (=changeable).
      </p>

      <p>
        Each value inside a list is called an item and these are placed between square
        brackets.
      </p>
      <code>my_list = [1, 2, 3]
        my_list2 = [“a”, “b”, “c”]
        my_list3 = [“4”, d, “book”, 5]</code>

    <header>Dictionaries</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        A dictionary holds indexes with keys that are mapped to certain values. These
        key-value pairs offer a great way of organizing and storing data in Python. They are
        mutable, meaning you can change the stored information.
      </p>
      <p>A key value can be either a string, Boolean, or integer. Here’s an example dictionary
        illustrating this:</p>

      <code>Customer 1= {‘username’: ‘john-sea’, ‘online’: false,
        ‘friends’:100}</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="If_Statements_in_Python">
    <header>If Statements in Python</header>
    <article>
      <p>Just like other programming languages, Python supports the basic logical
        conditions from math: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Equals: a == b</li>
        <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
        <li>Less than: a < b</li>
        <li>Less than or equal to a or b</li>
        <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
        <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
        The goal of a conditional statement is to check if it’s True or False:
        <code>if 5 > 1:
          print(“That’s True!”)</code>
        <p>For more complex operations, you can create nested if statements. Here’s how it
          looks:</p>
        <code>
          x = 35
          if x > 20:
          print(“Above twenty,”)
          if x > 30:
          print(“and also above 30!”)
        </code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Python_Loops">
    <header>Python Loops</header>
    <article>
      Python has two simple loop commands that are good to know:
      <ul>
        <li>For loops</li>
        <li>While loops</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As already illustrated in the other sections of this Python checklist, for loop is a
        handy way for iterating over a sequence such as a list, tuple, dictionary, string, etc.
        Here’s an example showing how to loop through a string:</p>
      <code>for x in “apple”:
        print(x)</code>
      <p>While loop enables you to execute a set of statements as long as the condition for
        them is true.</p>
      <code>#print as long as x is less than 8
        i = 1
        while i< 8: print(x) i +=1</code>
